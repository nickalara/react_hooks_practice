useImperativeHandle in a nutshell allows for methods which act on object state
to be passed from one components to another.

The "child" component contains the actual state method and the "parent"
component calls it.

This can be useful when you don't want a component to be otherwise accessed
from other parts of the application. This has implications for more secure
applications, as well as keep distinct parts of the overall app independent
from each other.
