// The useEffect is used to make the app "do something" every time something in its 2nd parameter's list changes
// In otherwords, everytime the page or something in the page refreshes, useEffect acts
// It's often used in conjunction with useState as seen here

    // For this example, call some sample data from jsonplaceholder
    // It doesn't need to call an API but this is a common use case (to set some sort of data every time a button is pressed. Maybe to call a new page of a table for example? *Wink wink*)

        // You can have multiple things in here if you want to "listen" for specific changes across a page
        // Or you can completely omit this second parameter if you want it to trigger when anything on the page happens (think about tracking user behavior maybe?)
